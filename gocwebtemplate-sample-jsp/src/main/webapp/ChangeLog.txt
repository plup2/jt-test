1.29.0 - 2018-11-27
    *** IMPORTANT ***
    PROJECT REFACTORING: The Java Web Templates are now Maven projects and archetypes.  The way the libraries
                         are referenced and the way to create projects from the samples has changed. Projects
                         are no longer tied to a particular Java container (ie WebLogic) or Eclipse version. 
                         Refer to the wiki of usage details.
    WebLogic 11g SUPPORT: Java Web Templates are now developped and tested using WebLogic 12c. Version 11g is
                          no longer supported.
    MAJOR CLEANUP: Previsouly deprecated classes have been removed. In particular, the DefaultTemplateBean class
                   hierarchy has been removed, DefaultTemplateCoreBean should be used instead.
    ******
    - (JSP project) Update of Struts version from 2.3.34 to 2.3.36 
    - Implementation of WET/CDTS v4.0.29
    - ContactLink has been changed to ContactLinks (setContactLink(...) has been kept for convenience, see sample for details)
    - Updated static fallback files
    - Bug fixes

************************************************************************************************************
1.28.0 (4.0.28.1) - 2018-06-22
    *** IMPORTANT *** 
    NEW VERSION SCHEME: To avoid further confusion with the CDTS version, starting with this release, the 
                        Java Web Template will be published using a new version scheme.
    WebLogic 11g SUPPORT: This is the last version supporting WebLogic 11g. Future versions will not  
                          include a package pre-configured for WebLogic 11g.               
    DEPRECATED CLASSES: This is the last version containing the legacy BaseBean/DefaultTemplateBean class
                        hierarchy, which was deprecated in version 4.0.26.1. 
                        BaseCoreBean/DefaultTemplateCoreBean must be used instead.

4.0.26.1 - 2017-12-01
    ***This version introduces changes to the internal "engine" which can have some impact on existing applications
    ***(at the very least to the main configuration file, cdn.properties). 
    - IMPORTANT: MAJOR UPDATE: cdn.properties: The way the configuration of environments/theme works was changed. Because there was a lot
                               of confusion regarding which CDTS URLs to use for which theme, most of the configuration was moved to an 
                               internal configuration file. All the configuration properties are still overridable in cdn.properties, but 
                               the way the URLs are parameterized was also changed (now using MessageFormat-style placeholders). IT IS 
                               HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT CURRENT cnd.properties FILES BE UPDATED FROM THIS NEW VERSION. Changes to 
                               cdn.properties are:
                                  - NEW ENVIRONMENT NAMES ARE NOW USED (Akamai, PROD_SSL, PROD_UNSECURE, ESDC_PROD, ESDC_GCIntranet_SADE,
                                    ESDC_GCIntranet_QA, ESDC_GCWEB_SADE and ESDC_GCWEB_QA)
                                  - THE cdn_*_url PROPERTIES WERE REMOVED.  If present (to override the default value), THE URL FORMAT MUST
                                    NOW USE {0}, {1},...{n} INSTEAD OF %s for placeholders (see cdn_localdev_url for an example).
                                  - The cdn_*_env properties were removed. If present, will override default value.
                                  - The webtemplate_theme property is now blank (which means the theme proper for each environment will be used).
    - MAJOR UPDATE: THE BaseBean/DefaultTemplateBean CLASS HIERARCHY HAS BEEN DEPRECATED.  Custom beans should now inherit from 
                    BaseCoreBean/DefaultTemplateCoreBean instead.   Instead of overriding multiple no-arg "set" methods to set the value of 
                    instance variables, a single "onWebTemplateInitialize" method must now be overriden and the proper "set" method for each 
                    property called to set its value. This change brings the Java template more in line with the Java standard and recommendations
                    on Java Beans. The sample pages have been updated to reflect this change.  Note that the "old" class hierachy is still present
                    and useable but WILL NOT BE UPDATED WITH NEW FEATURES AND WILL BE REMOVED COMPLETELY IN A FUTURE VERSION. It is recommened to
                    switch over to BaseCoreBean/DefaultTemplateCoreBean as soon as possible.
